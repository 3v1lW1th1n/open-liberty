#A timeout occurred. 
timeout.occurred.CWMFT0000E=CWMFT0000E: A timeout occurred.
timeout.occurred.CWMFT0000E.explanation=An operation took too long to complete for the configured Timeout.
timeout.occurred.CWMFT0000E.useraction=Increase the maximum duration of the Timeout or ensure that the operation completes faster. 

#No free capacity was available in the bulkhead for method {0}.
bulkhead.no.threads.CWMFT0001E=CWMFT0001E: No free capacity is available in the bulkhead for method {0}.
bulkhead.no.threads.CWMFT0001E.explanation=A call to the method did not succeed because the bulkhead for the method is full.
bulkhead.no.threads.CWMFT0001E.useraction=Increase availability in the bulkhead by increasing the capacity of the bulkhead or reducing the concurrent workload of this service.

application.shutdown.CWMFT0002W=CWMFT0002W: Cannot complete the asynchronous execution of method {0} because the application or component which called it has stopped
application.shutdown.CWMFT0002W.explanation=Asynchronous methods run in the context of the component that started them. The application or component that called the asynchronous method is no longer running and this has prevented the asynchronous method from running completely.
application.shutdown.CWMFT0002W.useraction=This warning usually occurs when the application or server is shutting down. If it's important that all started Asynchronous methods are completed, then the running application should wait for the result.

#An internal error occurred. The exception is {0}.
internal.error.CWMFT4998E=CWMFT4998E: An internal error occurred. The exception is {0}.
internal.error.CWMFT4998E.explanation=The application server experienced an internal error.
internal.error.CWMFT4998E.useraction=Gather a set of traces and open a new issue against your application server.

#Generic error for internal failures. 
internal.error.CWMFT4999E=CWMFT4999E: An internal error occurred.
internal.error.CWMFT4999E.explanation=The application server experienced an internal error.
internal.error.CWMFT4999E.useraction=Gather a set of traces and open a new issue against your application server.
